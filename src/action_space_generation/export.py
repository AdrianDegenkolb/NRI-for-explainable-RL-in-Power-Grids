"""
Convert ranked Grid2Op actions to this repo's action-space JSON format.

This repo's `grid2op_env.action_converters.load_actions` expects a JSON list of dicts, each
passed straight to `env.action_space(action_dict)` (see e.g. `data/action_spaces/
l2rpn_case14_sandbox/medha.json`). `BaseAction.as_serializable_dict()` produces exactly that
dict shape, so the conversion is a direct serialization with no reformatting.
