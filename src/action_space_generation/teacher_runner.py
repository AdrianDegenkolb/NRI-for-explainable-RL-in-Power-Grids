"""
Run the Fraunhofer `curriculumagent` N-1 Teacher on a Grid2Op grid.

This bypasses `curriculumagent.teacher.teacher.n_minus_1_teacher()`, which passes its `jobs`
argument positionally into `NMinusOneTeacher.collect_n_minus_1_experience`'s `number_of_years`
parameter (a bug in curriculumagent==1.1.2). `NMinusOneTeacher` is used directly instead, with
all arguments passed by keyword.

Must run in the `curriculum` conda environment (see `environment_curriculum.yaml`), never in
the main `L2RPN` training environment.

    per-chronic worker (`n_minus_one_agent`) directly instead, so a SLURM array can shard
    chronics across many nodes/tasks. Batching several chronics into one task (rather than one
    array task per chronic) keeps the array width under a cluster's `MaxArraySize` limit for
    datasets with thousands of chronics, and amortizes curriculumagent's heavy import cost
    (tensorflow, ray) across the batch instead of paying it once per chronic.
